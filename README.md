This is just a test repo where I will be testing some Web3 tools like [EthersJs](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) or [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com/)

Anyway, if you want to use it you should go to this [repo](https://github.com/mabopoi/todo-dapp-contract) and create the smart contract ABI. It goes in 'src' and must be named 'ToDoAppABI.json'.

After you deploy the smart contract in your ganache-cli node, you must add its address to an .env file (following .env.example)
